This is a website created by me , for me .

I will keep my development work on this repo and will update this once I have a full working product.

This website is being developed by using Google Materialize . I am planning to add blog section to it,even use a Feed API so that I can view news articles and create a presentation using reveal.js of beautiful pictures that I like.
