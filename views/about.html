          <p class="left-align light">I am a second year computer science graduate student at Rochester Institute of Technology. I typically take on software development work though I intend to work in different fields and make a difference to someone's life , somewhere . I like challenges as many at my age do and would like to give my best at whatever work I get , technical or non-technical . Feel free to browse through my work and some pictures that I feel close to my heart .  I intend to add a blog section to this site to make it more interactive for me . This way I can capture my thoughts . It is amazing ,this human mind . Reading about other people's lives I feel life is so beautiful and each one of us makes it so much more beautiful. Enjoy , smile and hope to chat with you someday . Have a great rest of your day! </p>
