          <p class="left-align light"> I am currently on track to join Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) as a Member of Technical Staff in the Network Automation team. I completed my Bachelor's degree (CS) from Manipal Institute of Technology and my Master's Degree (CS) from Rochester Institute of Technology. I have an year of co-op experience working at Lenovo as part of the Lenovo Open Cloud Team and at American Institutes for Research as part of their Assessment platform team. I am currently working on creating a resource to help "no so technical" folks learn programming. I like to solve problems and build new things from scratch. I would love to be part of teams making new applications and products for scale.  I am always on the lookout for new challenges and collaborations so please feel free to reach out! Additionally I would love your thoughts on this small portfolio and how I could impove it even more. Thank you and have a nice day!
